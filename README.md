# Project Introduction
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and involves creating a landing web page based on a given design, with some added touches. The goal of this project is to apply and build upon HTML, and CSS skills in a practical and engaging way.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to take a design and turn it into a functional web page while also implementing some of my own creativity and ideas. I believe that this project will help me improve my front-end development skills and push me towards becoming a better web developer.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project! Feel free to explore the code and leave any feedback or suggestions.
